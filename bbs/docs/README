5. Contributing

We're always looking for talented people to join us in developing the project. If you wish to improve the code, check out our SVN repository at http://novaboard.googlecode.com/svn/ and submit improvements via the issues system mentioned in section 4. Alternatively, if you wish to create a theme or module for NovaBoard, you're 100% welcome to do so, but we do ask that you post it in our forum - it makes it a lot easier for users to search through them, plus you'll benefit from our remote distribution system.
